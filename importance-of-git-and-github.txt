Git is installed and maintained on your local
system (rather than in the cloud) and gives 
you a self-contained record of your ongoing 
programming versions. 
It can be used completely exclusive of any 
cloud-hosting service — you don’t even need 
internet access, except to download it. 
Git is a high-quality version control system.

GitHub is designed as a Git repository hosting 
service.  It’s an online database that allows 
you to keep track of and share your Git version 
control projects outside of your local 
computer/server. 
Unlike Git, GitHub is exclusively cloud-based. 
Also unlike Git, GitHub is a for-profit service 
(although basic repository-hosting features are 
available at no cost to those who are willing 
to create a user profile, making GitHub a 
popular choice for open-source projects).
