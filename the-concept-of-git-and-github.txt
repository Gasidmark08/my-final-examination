Git is a type of version control system (VCS) that makes it easier to track changes to files. For example, when you edit a file, git can help you determine exactly what changed, who changed it, and why.

It’s useful for coordinating work among multiple people on a project, and for tracking progress over time by saving “checkpoints”. You could use it while writing an essay, or to track changes to artwork and design files.
Git comes installed by default on many systems. If you don’t already have it:

You can download git’s command-line interface (CLI) here. I recommended this for both beginners and advanced users.
If you prefer to use a fancy graphical user interface (GUI) instead, try GitHub Desktop (for Windows and Mac). This will be simpler to use, but will make it more difficult to really see what’s going on.

 GitHub is a highly used software that is typically used for version control. It is helpful when more than just one person is working on a project. Say for example, a software developer team wants to build a website and everyone has to update their codes simultaneously while working on the project. In this case, Github helps them to build a centralized repository where everyone can upload, edit, and manage the code files.
simple steps to create a GitHub repository: 

 -Go to the link: https://github.com/ . Fill the sign up form and click on “Sign up for Github”.
 -Click on “Start a new project”.
 -Enter any repository name and click on “Create Repository”. You can also give a description to your repository (optional).
